I selected a set of properties and methods needed to perform the HiLo Game. We need a pair of classes: Gamemaster and a card.

**Gamemaster class** has the following properties:
- points
- prev_card
- next_card

Also the methods:
- propose_game
- eval_inputs
- check_status

**Card class** has only the following property:
- value

And the method:
- draw
